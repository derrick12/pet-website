    <h3>Meeting Rufus.</h3>
    <p>
      On the cold month of July  2014 I was visiting my grand-parents at the highlands of Naivasha and yes you guessed it,
       gets terribly cold there at that time of month. Usually my grand_parents are always heavily dressed to prevent the
       piercing cold whenever they are at the farm tending to animals or crops. That day there was a new animal in the house
       hold, a puppy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The puppy a bit shy and plump, would not let anyone get hold of him, though when outside at the farm extremly playfull. He chased every sizeable animal he could find. The hens, terrorized them! Stressed out grandma a whole lot chasing her animals like that. He was one funny but weird dog that left me laughing most part of the day.
      I just loved the dog! It was easy to convince my grandparents to carry him back home.
